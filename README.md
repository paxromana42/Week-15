# Scripting Practice

In class today, we’re going to spend some time attempting some potential scripts that might be helpful for implementation of a corporate network. In project #6, you’re going to get some practice using backup scripts, but there are all manner of other tasks that can also be accomplished and automated using scripts!  Successful completion of this exercise is worth up to 10 bonus points on Project #6.
